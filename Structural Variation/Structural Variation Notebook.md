### Entry 1: 2023-11-06.   
- focusing on variation across the genome
- different types 
  - deletions
  - insertions
  - duplications
  - inversions
  - translocations
- less than 50bp distinguishes small v large variations
- today focusing on large-scale

Sea Urchins!!
- 140 purple sea urchins from 7 populations
- experiencing diff levels of ph variability

Beginning Work
- chromosome number = NW_022145595.1
- made scripts and started running local PCA
