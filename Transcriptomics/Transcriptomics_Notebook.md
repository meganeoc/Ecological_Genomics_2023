### Entry 1: 2023-10-11.   
#### What could we do with the experimental information?
Seems like a simple experiment, but there are tons of ways to explore it
- Effect of environment on levels of G.E.
    - is there a unique response to the combined treatment?
    - what are the functional categories of DEGs?
- Signature of physiological adaptation
    - decline initially in new environment, get better, then die again
    - in F2, F4, F11
    - across generations within the environment
    - across environments within a generation
- Interaction between env. condition and generation

#### Coding
My Sample Group: F0 (Ambient AA)(Nreps3)
- Good quality scores, most Fs
- Cleaned data using FastP 0.23.4
  - went into "fastp" directory in myresults
- recorded stats from clean files including reads before/after filtering, and percentage reads passed filters, put them in the google doc
